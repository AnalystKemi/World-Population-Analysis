# World-Population-Analysis
##### Title
World Population Exploratory Data Analysis

##### Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world population dataset. This analysis aims to uncover insights into global population trends, demographic changes, and growth patterns over time. By visualizing and analyzing the data, I seek to identify key factors influencing population growth and distribution across different countries and continents.

##### Dataset Overview
The world population dataset provides historical and current population data for various countries and regions around the world. It includes multiple demographic indicators that help in understanding population dynamics.
